The ***`swift-ip`*** library is a portable, Foundation-free library for working with IP addresses. It provides tools for parsing and formatting IP addresses, data structures for performing efficient IP address lookups, and shims for compatibility with types from other libraries such as SwiftNIO.

One of the paramount goals of this library is to allow other libraries to exchange strongly-typed values with zero overhead without falling back to raw integer representations or linking against large frameworks.
